## üìå Overview

This repository contains a reproducible end-to-end pipeline for the [**Cinema Audience Forecasting**](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cinema-audience-forecasting) Kaggle competition.

The goal is to predict the `audience_count` for each unique show (identified by `ID`) using:
- Booking records (`booknow_booking.csv`)
- Theater metadata (`booknow_theaters.csv`, `cinePOS_theaters.csv`)
- Daily visits (`booknow_visits.csv`)
- Calendar features (`date_info.csv`)
- Theater ID mappings (`movie_theater_id_relation.csv`)

- **Evaluation Metric**: Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- **Baseline Model**: Feature-engineered Linear Regression / Random Forest  
- **Best Public Score**: _[Insert your score here]_

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: You must **accept the competition rules on the Kaggle website** before downloading data or submitting predictions. This cannot be done via the API.
